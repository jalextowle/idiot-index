# Idiot Index Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Current)

### Database Schema Enhancement
- [ ] Extend current models.py with:
  ```python
  class Product:
    - id: UUID
    - name: str
    - description: text
    - retail_price: decimal
    - materials_cost: decimal
    - idiot_index: decimal (computed)
    - created_at: datetime
    - updated_at: datetime
    - source_url: str
    - verified: boolean

  class Component:
    - id: UUID
    - product_id: UUID (parent)
    - component_id: UUID (child)
    - quantity: decimal
    - unit: str
    - created_at: datetime
    - updated_at: datetime

  class RawMaterial:
    - id: UUID
    - name: str
    - current_price: decimal
    - unit: str
    - source_url: str
    - last_updated: datetime
  ```

### Authentication System
- [ ] Implement Flask-Login for admin authentication
- [ ] Create AdminUser model
- [ ] Set up login/logout routes
- [ ] Add admin middleware for protected routes

### Basic API Endpoints
- [ ] GET /api/products - List all products with idiot index
- [ ] GET /api/products/<id> - Get product details with components
- [ ] GET /api/products/<id>/graph - Get full component graph
- [ ] POST /api/products (admin) - Add new product
- [ ] PUT /api/products/<id> (admin) - Update product
- [ ] POST /api/components (admin) - Add component relationship

## Phase 2: UI Development

### Public Interface
- [ ] Product List View
  - Grid/list toggle
  - Sorting by idiot index, price, name
  - Basic filtering
- [ ] Product Detail View
  - Product information card
  - Component breakdown
  - Visual graph representation
- [ ] Interactive Component Graph
  - D3.js visualization
  - Clickable nodes for navigation
  - Zoom and pan controls

### Admin Interface
- [ ] Login Page
- [ ] Product Management Dashboard
- [ ] Add/Edit Product Form
  - Basic information
  - Component relationships
  - Raw material costs
- [ ] Batch Update Interface
  - Price updates
  - Component relationship management

## Phase 3: Data Collection

### Web Scraping Infrastructure
- [ ] Create scrapers/ directory with base scraper class
- [ ] Implement retailer-specific scrapers:
  - [ ] Home Depot
  - [ ] Amazon
  - [ ] McMaster-Carr
- [ ] Price monitoring system
- [ ] Automated updates for raw material prices

### Data Validation
- [ ] Input validation for all forms
- [ ] Component cycle detection
- [ ] Price consistency checks
- [ ] Data freshness monitoring

## Phase 4: Advanced Features

### Analytics
- [ ] Industry-specific idiot index averages
- [ ] Price trend analysis
- [ ] Supply chain optimization suggestions
- [ ] Export functionality for reports

### API Enhancement
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- [ ] Bulk operations endpoints
- [ ] Webhook support for price updates

### Visualization Improvements
- [ ] Supply chain flow diagrams
- [ ] Cost breakdown charts
- [ ] Time-series price tracking
- [ ] Comparative analysis views

## Technical Debt & Infrastructure

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for models
- [ ] API endpoint tests
- [ ] Integration tests for scrapers
- [ ] UI component tests

### Documentation
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Admin user guide
- [ ] Development setup guide
- [ ] Deployment instructions

### DevOps
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Monitoring setup
- [ ] Backup strategy
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Future Considerations

### Scalability
- [ ] Caching layer
- [ ] Background job processing
- [ ] Database optimization
- [ ] CDN integration

### Features
- [ ] User accounts for saving favorites
- [ ] Price alerts
- [ ] Mobile app
- [ ] Browser extension
- [ ] Alternative material suggestions
- [ ] Sustainability metrics

## Current Focus
1. Complete Phase 1 core infrastructure
2. Implement basic product and component models
3. Create simple admin interface
4. Set up initial web scraping system

## Next Steps
1. Enhance models.py with the complete schema
2. Implement authentication system
3. Create basic API endpoints
4. Begin work on the public interface

Remember: Start small with a curated set of simple products to validate the concept before expanding to more complex items and automated data collection.
